  heading: Health Insurance Plans for Individuals and Families
  description: >+
    In life many things are unexpected — like being diagnosed with a serious
    illness, or a hit and run car accident — your hospital bills can quickly
    become insurmountable when faced with these medical issues. Health insurance
    isn’t just about leveraging that financial risk. Your health plan will
    decide if you can choose the doctor you want for your treatment. Your health
    insurance plan will decide if you can seek treatment at the best cancer
    center, as opposed to the facility closest to you. Your health insurance
    will decide whether you can get a second opinion from a doctor or not. The
    list goes on, and there are many factors to consider before choosing the
    right health insurance policy for you and your family.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
