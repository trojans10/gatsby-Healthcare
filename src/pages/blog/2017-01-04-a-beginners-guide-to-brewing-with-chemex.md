The Democratic presidential candidates gathered in Detroit last week for their second round of debates. And, this time, there was a clear winner: "Medicare for All."

The win came because Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. — working together not as rivals but as a progressive tag team — dared to call out more conservative Democratic candidates and debate moderators for peddling “Republican talking points” in their objections to replacing private insurance with a program that guarantees health care as a human right. The progressive contenders bluntly labeled compromises on health care as “wrong.”

For supporters of single-payer health care, which rarely gets a fair hearing in media coverage, Tuesday night’s debate was an epic moment. And Warren and Sanders seized it to directly challenge the hostility that political and media elites hold not just for this reform but for the idea that Democrats should again be the party of what Warren describes as “big structural change.”
