President Donald Trump plans to focus on Medicare - the US government program of medical assistance for the elderly - when visiting a community for retirees in Florida next week.



The White House said Trump will visit the Villages population on August 6 to discuss the progress made by his government to "secure and improve" the government's medical assistance program for those over 65.



Meanwhile, candidates for the Democratic presidential candidacy for 2020 debate among themselves about the possibility of expanding Medicare to cover the entire population.



It will be Trump's first visit to Florida since mid-June, when he formally announced his intention to run for re-election at an event in Orlando. If Trump wants a second four-year term in the White House, it is considered that winning Florida is virtually crucial.
